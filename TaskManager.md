# Task Manager Project Overview:

## Description:
The Task Manager is a web application that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks. The application will incorporate various features such as user authentication, database storage, file handling, and external API integration.

## Features:
1. User Authentication: Users can register for an account and log in to access their tasks.
2. Task Management: Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks.
3. Task Categories: Users can organize tasks into different categories (e.g., personal, work).
4. Task Priority: Users can assign priorities to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
5. Task Due Dates: Users can set due dates for tasks.
6. Task Search: Users can search for tasks by title or category.
7. Task Statistics: Users can view statistics on their tasks, such as total tasks completed and pending tasks.
8. External API Integration: Integration with a weather API to display weather information and remind users to complete tasks based on weather conditions.

## Episode-wise Development Plan:
1. **Episode 1: Introduction to Python and Setting Up Development Environment**
   - Set up Flask environment and project structure.
   - Create basic Flask application with routes for home page and user authentication (login, register).
   
2. **Episode 2: Basic Python Syntax and Variables**
   - Implement functionality to create and display tasks.
   - Use Python variables to store task data.

3. **Episode 3: Control Flow and Conditional Statements**
   - Implement CRUD operations for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - Use conditional statements for user authentication and authorization.

4. **Episode 4: Functions and Modular Programming**
   - Refactor codebase to use functions for task management operations.
   - Implement modular programming principles to improve code organization.

5. **Episode 5: Working with Files and Error Handling**
   - Integrate file handling to store user tasks persistently (e.g., using JSON or CSV format).
   - Implement error handling for file operations and user inputs.

6. **Episode 6: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Refactor codebase to use classes and objects for task representation.
   - Implement object-oriented design principles to enhance code readability and maintainability.

7. **Episode 7: Python Libraries and APIs**
   - Integrate with a weather API to provide weather information to users.
   - Enhance user experience by displaying weather-related task reminders.

8. **Episode 8: Final Project Showcase and Next Steps**
   - Showcase the completed Task Manager application.
   - Discuss potential enhancements and additional features for future development.
   - Provide guidance on next steps for viewers to continue their learning journey.
